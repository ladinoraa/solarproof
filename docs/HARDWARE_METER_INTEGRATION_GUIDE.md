# Hardware Meter Integration Guide

This guide is for hardware manufacturers who want to integrate their smart meters with SolarProof. It covers hardware requirements, the signing protocol, API integration steps, and the certification process for new meter models.

---

## Hardware Requirements

### Ed25519 Key Storage

Every SolarProof-compatible meter must generate and store an Ed25519 keypair. The private key must never leave the device.

| Requirement | Minimum | Recommended |
|---|---|---|
| Key storage | Secure flash with access control | Hardware Security Module (HSM) or TPM 2.0 |
| Key generation | On-device CSPRNG | On-device CSPRNG with hardware entropy source |
| Key protection | Software access control | HSM / secure enclave (YubiKey, ATECC608, TPM) |
| Curve | Ed25519 | Ed25519 |
| Key size | 32-byte private key, 32-byte public key | Same |

**Minimum viable hardware:**
- Microcontroller with at least 64 KB flash and 16 KB RAM
- Hardware RNG or entropy source
- Persistent storage that survives power cycles
- Network interface (Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or cellular) capable of HTTPS

**Recommended hardware:**
- Dedicated HSM chip (e.g., Microchip ATECC608B, Infineon SLB 9670 TPM)
- Secure boot to prevent firmware tampering
- Tamper-evident enclosure

### Connectivity

- HTTPS (TLS 1.2+) to reach the SolarProof API
- Accurate real-time clock (RTC) — timestamp drift must be within ±30 seconds
- Minimum 1 kB/s uplink for reading submissions

## API Integration Steps

### Step 1 — Generate and Register the Meter Keypair

Generate an Ed25519 keypair at manufacture time or on first boot. Store the private key in secure storage. Register the public key with the SolarProof operator before the meter goes live.

**Reference script (development/testing only — do not use in production firmware):**

```bash
node scripts/gen-meter-key.mjs
# Outputs meter-key.json: { private_key_hex, public_key_hex }
```

Register the public key in the SolarProof database:

```sql
INSERT INTO meters (id, pubkey_hex, cooperative_id, active)
VALUES ('<uuid>', '<64-char hex public key>', '<cooperative-uuid>', true);
```

The operator will provide the `cooperative_id` and confirm the `meter_id` (UUID) assigned to your device.

### Step 2 — Compute the Canonical Reading Hash

Before signing, compute a deterministic SHA-256 hash of the reading:

```
SHA-256( meter_id_utf8 || kwh_stroops_le64 || timestamp_le64 )
```

- `meter_id_utf8` — the meter UUID as a UTF-8 byte string (e.g. `"a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890"`)
- `kwh_stroops_le64` — `round(kwh × 10_000_000)` as a little-endian 64-bit signed integer
- `timestamp_le64` — Unix epoch seconds (UTC) as a little-endian 64-bit signed integer

**Node.js reference:**

```js
import { createHash } from 'crypto'

function computeReadingHash(meterId, kwh, timestamp) {
  const kwhStroops = BigInt(Math.round(kwh * 1e7))
  const meterBytes = Buffer.from(meterId, 'utf8')
  const kwhBuf = Buffer.alloc(8)
  kwhBuf.writeBigInt64LE(kwhStroops)
  const tsBuf = Buffer.alloc(8)
  tsBuf.writeBigInt64LE(BigInt(timestamp))
  return createHash('sha256').update(meterBytes).update(kwhBuf).update(tsBuf).digest()
}
```

The server uses the identical algorithm in `apps/web/src/lib/crypto.ts`. Any deviation will cause signature verification to fail.

### Step 3 — Sign the Reading

Sign the 32-byte hash with the device's Ed25519 private key. The signature must be 64 bytes, encoded as a 128-character lowercase hex string.

**Node.js reference:**

```js
import { createSign } from 'crypto'

function signReading(readingHash, privateKeyHex) {
  const privKeyDer = Buffer.concat([
    Buffer.from('302e020100300506032b657004220420', 'hex'),
    Buffer.from(privateKeyHex, 'hex'),
  ])
  const sign = createSign('ed25519')
  sign.update(readingHash)
  return sign.sign({ key: privKeyDer, format: 'der', type: 'pkcs8' }).toString('hex')
}
```

For HSM-backed devices, use the HSM's signing API to produce the Ed25519 signature over the hash bytes — the output format is the same.

### Step 4 — Submit the Reading

```
POST /api/readings
Content-Type: application/json
```

**Request body:**

```json
{
  "meter_id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890",
  "kwh": 12.5,
  "timestamp": 1745500800,
  "signature_hex": "<128-char lowercase hex>"
}
```

**Success — `201 Created`:**

```json
{
  "reading_id": "<uuid>",
  "anchor_tx_hash": "<64-char hex>",
  "mint_tx_hash": "<64-char hex>"
}
```

**Error codes:**

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `400` | Malformed payload or validation failure |
| `401` | Invalid Ed25519 signature |
| `404` | Meter not found or inactive |
| `409` | Duplicate reading (already anchored) |
| `500` | Stellar transaction failure |

### Step 5 — End-to-End Test with Reference Scripts

Use the reference scripts in `scripts/` to validate your integration before certification:

```bash
# Generate a test keypair
node scripts/gen-meter-key.mjs

# Send a signed reading to a local or staging instance
node scripts/send-reading.mjs \
  --meter-id <your-meter-uuid> \
  --kwh 12.5 \
  --key ./meter-key.json \
  --api http://localhost:3000

# Run the full end-to-end flow
node scripts/e2e-meter-reading-flow.mjs
```

See `docs/METER_INTEGRATION.md` for the full protocol reference including the complete API specification.

## Reference Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `scripts/gen-meter-key.mjs` | Generate an Ed25519 keypair for a meter device |
| `scripts/send-reading.mjs` | Sign and submit a single meter reading |
| `scripts/e2e-meter-reading-flow.mjs` | Full end-to-end flow: key generation → reading → anchor → mint → verify |

All scripts require Node.js v22+ and are intended for development, testing, and certification validation. Do not use them in production firmware.
