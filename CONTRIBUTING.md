# Contributing to SolarProof

Thanks for contributing! PRs target `develop`. All CI must pass before merge.

## Getting Started

1. Browse [open issues](../../issues) — look for `good first issue`
2. Comment to claim before starting
3. Fork and branch from `develop`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnnabelJoe/solarproof.git
cd solarproof
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feat/your-feature
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

| Bug fix | `fix/<short-description>-<issue>` | `fix/signature-validation-17` |
| Docs | `docs/<short-description>` | `docs/contract-interfaces` |
| Chore / CI | `chore/<short-description>` | `chore/turbo-remote-cache` |
| Release | `release/v<semver>` | `release/v1.2.0` |

## Development Commands

```bash
pnpm dev                              # Next.js dev server
pnpm lint                             # ESLint + tsc
pnpm build                            # Full monorepo build
cd apps/contracts && cargo test       # Rust contract tests
cd apps/contracts && stellar contract build  # Build WASM
```

## PR Checklist

Before opening a PR, confirm:

- [ ] Branch is based on `develop` (not `main`)
- [ ] Branch name follows the convention above
- [ ] All commits follow Conventional Commits format
- [ ] `pnpm lint` passes with no errors
- [ ] `pnpm build` succeeds
- [ ] Relevant tests added or updated
- [ ] `cargo test` passes for any contract changes
- [ ] Docs updated if public interfaces changed
- [ ] PR description references the issue (`Closes #<n>`)
- [ ] No secrets or `.env` files committed

---

## Code Review Expectations

**For authors:**
- Keep PRs focused — one concern per PR
- Respond to review comments within 2 business days
- Resolve conversations before requesting re-review
- Don't force-push after review has started (use new commits)

**For reviewers:**
- Review within 2 business days of assignment
- Distinguish blocking issues from suggestions (prefix suggestions with `nit:`)
- Approve only when all blocking issues are resolved
- At least 1 approval required before merge

**Merge strategy:** Squash and merge into `develop`. Merge commits into `main` for releases only.

---

## Smart Contract Changes

Contract changes require extra care:

- All public function signatures are part of the on-chain ABI — breaking changes need a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer
- Update `docs/contracts/<name>.md` for any interface changes
- Run `cargo test` and include test output in the PR description
- Tag breaking changes with the `breaking-change` label

## Reporting Issues

Use the [issue templates](../../issues/new/choose). For security vulnerabilities, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

---

## Regression Tests

Every closed bug issue must have a corresponding regression test to prevent the bug from being silently reintroduced.

### Process

1. **When a bug is fixed**, add a regression test in the same PR as the fix (or in a follow-up PR referencing the issue).
2. **File location** — regression tests live in `apps/web/src/app/api/__tests__/regression.test.ts` for API-layer bugs. For contract bugs, add tests in the relevant contract's `#[cfg(test)]` module.
3. **Naming convention** — test names must include the issue number:
   - TypeScript: `it('test_issue_<N>_<description>', ...)`
   - Rust: `#[test] fn test_issue_<N>_<description>()`
4. **Link the issue** — add a comment at the top of the test or describe block referencing the issue number and a one-line description of the bug.
5. **CI** — regression tests run automatically in CI via `pnpm test` (TypeScript) and `cargo test` (Rust). No extra configuration is needed.

### Example

```ts
// Regression for #29 — API routes accepted raw input without schema validation
it('test_issue_29_readings_rejects_negative_kwh', async () => {
  const res = await POST(makeRequest({ meter_id: METER_ID, kwh: -1, ... }))
  expect(res.status).toBe(400)
})
```

### Covered issues

| Issue | Description | Test file |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| #29 | Input validation on all API routes | `src/app/api/__tests__/regression.test.ts` |
| #49 | Stellar account existence check before minting | `src/app/api/__tests__/regression.test.ts` |
| #51 | Overflow protection in energy_token mint arithmetic | `apps/contracts/energy_token/src/lib.rs` |
| #73 | Reading deduplication in audit_registry | `apps/contracts/audit_registry/src/lib.rs`, `src/app/api/__tests__/regression.test.ts` |
