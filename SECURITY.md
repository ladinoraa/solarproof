## Scope

### In Scope

- **Meter Proofs:** Ed25519 signature verification bypasses.
- **Certificate Lifecycle:** Unauthorized retirement or minting of tokens.
- **Chain of Custody:** Data manipulation in the `/api/verify` or anchor registry.
- **Smart Contracts:** Vulnerabilities in `energy_token`, `audit_registry`, or `community_governance`.
- **Infrastructure:** Supabase RLS policy bypasses or authentication flaws.

### Out of Scope

- Vulnerabilities in the Stellar network itself (please report to the [Stellar Foundation](https://stellar.org/security)).
- Attacks requiring physical access to a meter device (unless the attack scales to other devices).
- Social engineering, phishing, or denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
- Third-party library vulnerabilities (unless they result from our specific usage).

## Bug Bounty

SolarProof does not currently operate a paid bug bounty program. However, we are happy to:

- Publicly credit researchers in our security advisories.
- Provide a letter of appreciation for significant findings.
- Offer early access to upcoming features.
